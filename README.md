This Android application demonstrates how to make HTTP POST and GET requests to a RESTful API without using Retrofit. The app performs two main functions:

1. **getProfile**: Sends a GET request to the API to retrieve user profile information and displays it on the screen.

2. **createPost**: Sends a POST request to the API to create a new post with provided username, title, and body, and displays the response on the screen.


## Technologies Used

- Kotlin: Kotlin is used as the primary programming language for Android development.
- Android SDK: The application is developed using the Android Software Development Kit.
- HttpURLConnection: Standard Java library for making HTTP requests without any additional dependencies.
- Coroutine: Used for asynchronous programming to perform network requests off the main UI thread.
- JSON: Handling JSON data received from the API.
